> **Context:**
We look to access an example MongoDB Database - the ProductOrder
database. The ProductOrder database maintains an inventory of TV products of
various brands and models. It allows users to place orders for one or more of
these items, and offers discounts on these purchases.
In the ProductOrder database, there are mainly four categories of information:
● Product information
● Inventory information
● User information
● Order information

> **Objective:**
Having all this information in place we need to create a Database called
ProductOrder and various collections in it. The collections needed and
attributes which need to be in every collection are given by the Organization.
Create collections with data in it and write queries so
that the organization can retrieve required information.
